# Python-Galaxy-Generator
Generates a Y-axis 2D representation of a 3D galaxy. 

Please not the this program requires Python and either PIL or pillow, both of which I'm pretty sure work with this. You should probably 
name your galaxies after making them, just because.

A small .py that allows you to input values to create a galaxy.
This script generates a 3D galaxy from a number of parameters and stores
it in an array. You can modify this script to store the data in a database
or whatever your purpose is. THIS script uses the data only to generate a
PNG with a 2D view from top of the galaxy. 
The algorithm used to generate the galaxy is borrowed from Ben Motz
<motzb@hotmail.com>. The original C source code for DOS (including a 3D
viewer) can be downloaded here:

Unfortunately, the original python code source has been lost to time and a lack of wanting-to- search-through-several-hundred-webpages-for-one-webarchive-page. Sorry, original python guy.
A fair portion of the revisions and code is from /u/_Foxtrot_ on reddit. They are much better with the python-fu than I!
